# 2022-ML-Algorithms

During my NOAA internship in 2022, I made 5 Machine Learning Regression Algorithms to predict hurricane intensity.
Was able to present my results at the AMS103 Conference in Denver, CO. 

A list of the algorithms include:
-> Linear Regression
-> Support Vector Regression
-> Decision Tree Regression
-> Random Forest Regression
-> Deep Neural Network

They are seperated into 5 files. Check them out!
